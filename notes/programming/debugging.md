# Debugging

Majority of debuggers have the following features:

- `breakpoint` - a line that you want to debug, the debugger will halt the program at this point
- `continue` - continue to the next break point
- `step into` - steps into code, if debugging a function the debugger will step into the function and go over each line
- `step over` - steps over a line, a function will be executed without debugging each line
- `step out` - steps out into where the function was originally called and suspends execution
- `call stack` - can think of this as a history of how the program got to where it is
