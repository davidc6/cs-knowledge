Records - group of items that allow indexed access to each item (structs)

Lexically scoped closures - procedure combined with it's external references (everything that it references outside of itself). Think of it as piece of work that can be passed around run at any time.

Independence (concurrency) - activities can evolve independently, can run concurrently. Most popular ideas are shared-state and message-passing. 

Named state - a piece of state can be given a name. State can be thought of as am abstract representation of time in a program.
