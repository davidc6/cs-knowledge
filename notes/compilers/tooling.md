## Static Program Analysis

It is a technique designed to extract information from a program's source code 
to approximate runtime behaviour of a program. In order words, it attempts to 
predicts the output of a running program without running it.

Security vulnerabilities, code beautification, dead code detection can be detected 
by a static analysis.

These are other types of analysis such as **dynamic analysis** and **model checking**. 
Tools such as Valgrind perform dynamic analysis. They extract and verify data 
from a program as it runs. Model checking (also sometimes known as property checking)
is an approach (formal verification method) to verify the desired behavioural 
properties of a given system on the basis of a suitable model of the system. This is 
done through systematic inspection of all states.
