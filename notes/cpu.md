# Processor

CPU (Central Processing Unit) - interprets instructors stores in main memory. Essentially, it's a word-size storage device called program counter (PC). PC contains address of some machine-language instruction in main-memory.

Instruction set architecture - defines how a processor operates on this very simple instruction execution model.

The processor reads the instruction from memory pointed at by the PC, interprets the bits, performs simple operations and updates PC to point to next instruction. 

Instructions revolve around main memory, the register file (small storage that consists of word-size registers) and ALU. 

Each instruction tells the computer to add, subtract, multiply, or divide two numbers, compare numbers to see if they are equal or which is larger, and move numbers between the CPU and a location in memory. The rest of the instructions are mostly housekeeping.

Example of such operations:

- Load: copy a byte/word from main memory into a register
- Store: copy a byte/word from a register to a location in main memory
- Operate
    - copy the contents of two registers to ALU
    - perform arithmetic operation on the words
    - store results in a register
- Jump: extract a word from the instruction and copy the word into the program counter (PC)

All of the these overwrites previous contents.

CPU components
    - PC (Program Counter)
    - Register file (array of processors registers)
    - ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)
    - Bus Interface (the mechanism by which CPU communicates with memory and devices)

Because processors run faster than memory, small, faster storage devices called cache memories are used inside the CPU. The main idean is that one level serves as cache for level below it. There are different levels of caches:

A single CPU can execute multiple processes concurrently by having a processor switch among them. The interleaving is performed by the OS using a mechanism known as **context switching**.

Transition from one process to another is managed by the kernel (resides in memory). When action (read, write a file, etc.) is required to be performed by the OS, a special system call instruction is executed which transfers the call to the kernel. 

OS keeps track of all the state information that the process needs in order to run. This state is known as the context.

## Threads

A thread is a unit of execution. A process can have multiple threads, running in the context of the context of a process and sharing same code and data. Threads are typical more efficient that processes, and it is easier to share data between threads than processes.

Hyperthreading - when a single CPU can execute multiple flows of control, involves having multiple copies of some of CPU hardware (program counter, register files) and having single copies of such things as floating-point arithmetic unit. 

## Cache

L0 (~1 kb) - Registers
L1 (~256 kb) - holds tens of thousands of bytes and nearly as fast as the registers (2kb to 64kb)
    - Can be split into two parts: one to hold recently fetched instructions, one to hold data
L2 (~1 mb) - larger cache, hundreds of thousands to millions of bytes, connected to the processor by special bus and 5 times longer for processor to access
but 5 to 10 times faster than accessing the main memory
L1 & L2 - are implemented using *SRAM* (static random access memory)
L3 (~8 mb) - some more powerful systems have this level too. This is shared between CPUs.
L4 (128 mb) - still quite uncommon and is generally (DRAM), 

L4 - (**DRAM**) main memory
L5 - local disk
    - How is memory laid out in pages, page fault (page does exist in RAM). Dirty bit is whether that page was touched and used. Cache eviction (LRU) 
L6 - remote storage

Cache lines - chunks of memory handled by cache are called cache lines. It is a block of data of fixed size that gets transferred between memory and cache. 
Cache miss - 

Set - a row in the cache. The number of blocks per set is determined by the layout of cache (direct mapped, set-associative, or fully associative)

Block - the basic unit for cache storage, may contain multiple bytes/words of data.

Locality - tendency to access data and code in localized regions. By setting up caches to hold data that is frequently accessed, most memory operations can be performed using the fast caches. 

## Memory (Physical / Virtual)

**Virtual memory** - an abstraction that provides each process with an illusion that it has exclusive use of the memory. A process has the same uniform view of memory which is known as its **virtual address space**. In order to translate every address generated by the process, an interaction is required between the hardware and OS. A Linux virtual address space consists of:
    - kernel virtual memory, reserved for the kernel, applications do not read or write to it
    - user stack (created at run-time and grows downward, expands and shrinks dynamically)
    - shared libraries, holds code and data for shared libraries (i.e. c standard library, rust std library, etc.)
    - heap (run-time), expands and contracts dynamically as the result of calling `malloc` and `free` in C (`alloc` and `dealloc` in Rust)
    - program code (read-only code and data) and data (read/write data)

- Virtual to physical page translations - 
Providing an elusion 

Every process has it's own virtual memory mapping. Two processes might have the same virtual address mapped to different physical space

## Files

A file is just a sequence of bytes. Every device (disk, keyboard, network etc) is modeled as file. IO in the system is performed by reading and writing files using system calls (Unix I/O).

## Concurrency

- Thread-level concurrency
- Instruction-level parallelism - processors can execute multiple instructions at one time
- Single-Instruction, Multiple-Data (SIMD) Parallelism - (aka short vector processors) single instruction to cause multiple operations to be performed in parallel. These instructions are provided in order to speed up applications that process image, sound and video data.

## Storage

- Smallest addressable unit of memory - 8 bit or 1 byte. Virtual memory is a very large array of bytes and that's how machine-level program views memory. Every bytes of memory is identified by a unique number (aka address). Set of such addresses is virtual address space. The value of C pointer is the virtual address of the first byte of some block os storage. Pointers (in C) reference elements of data structures and have two aspects a value (location of an object) and type (kind of object, integer or floating-point number) that are stored at a location. 

## Data Size

**Word size** is the size of the pointer data (e.g. 32bit or 64bit). To work out the max virtual addresses 2 to the power of n (n being n-bit word size). So for 64bit word sizes, this will be approximately 18 exabytes. 32bit word size is 4 byte pointer, 64bit is 8 byte (in C).

## Addressing and Byte Ordering

Objects that span multiple bytes must have an address and how the bytes will be ordered in memory. Multi-byte objects are usually stored as stored as contiguous sequence of bytes, with the smallest address of the bytes used as the address. 

- Big endian - ordering of the bytes starts from the high-order byte (most significant, left-most byte to least, right-most).

- Little endian - ordering of the bytes starts from the low-order byte (least significant, left-most byte to most, right-most).

Byte ordering becomes important when binary data is communicated over the network and the source is produced the machine of one endianness and received by another.
