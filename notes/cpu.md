# Processor

CPU (Central Processing Unit) - interprets instructors stores in main memory. Essentially, it's a word-size storage device called program counter (PC). PC contains address of some machine-language instruction in main-memory.

Instruction set architecture - defines how a processor operates on this very simple instruction execution model.

The processor reads the instruction from memory pointed at by the PC, interprets the bits, performs simple operations and updates PC to point to next instruction. 

Instructions revolve around main memory, the register file (small storage that consists of word-size registers) and ALU. 

Operations:

- Load
- Store
- Operate 
- Jump
